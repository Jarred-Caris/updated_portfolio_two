## Installation
none
## Technology
Pretty much everything. MySql, Express, handlebars, javascript, html, css

## Success
This was a huge project. Ive spent longer on this one than any other in the past. But I feel proud with my initial groundwork,. The projects backend was fairly simple to complete, using past activities and online references. With every little win, with the complexity of the project, i felt a sense of achievement. Im happy my code came through not overly complicated and fairly easy to read. 

## Holdbacks
Time was my main factor in why it took so long and why it was so difficult. Working full time and learning new systems at work on top of new technologies really hindered my experience. Also it was a lot of information to remember and work with starting from scratch. So many files effecting others, id find id make one step forward and 2 steps back quite frequently. I feel a little more confident with this set up but still have a long way to go.


## Contribution
No starting code given so was completely built from scratch. I contributed soley on this project with assistance from TA and tutor through bootcamp

## Test
no testing
