## Installation
none
## Technology
html and css

## Success
The last update i did to my profile was a complete overhaul and I am happy with the results for now. I updated to included some newer projects and assignments but fo now, the layout im happy with and everything is up to date

## Holdbacks
none. future development though, id like to look at adding animations, maybe a more stylised look and making it look more professional. These things will take time to learn and i want to focus on the course subjects before looking outside their scope. 


## Contribution
Used previous layout and updated links where needed. 

## Test
no testing
